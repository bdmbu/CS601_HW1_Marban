    Originally from Spain, I have always had an energetic personality that was not afraid of a challenge. I have spent the last few years studying and working in the US, Australia, Malta and Switzerland. What I valued the most was the chance to work with and experience so many different and amazing cultures. Take a look at my resume!

    Currently, I am working in Switzerland as a financial controller for a startup. From January 2022 I will work at a Reinsurance company as a junior CRM manager. I am always keen to learn new things and the new position is a perfect opportunity for this. I will finish my Software Development Masters at Boston University in May 2022 which will fully help me transition into a more technical role.

    In the future, I would love to combine my passion for technology and finance and help organizations streamline and automatize their processes.
